Write-up of your project and findings go here. Think of this as the text
of your handout. The length should be roughly 5 minutes when read
out loud. Although pacing varies, a 5-minute speech is roughly 750
words. 

Your results with proper output and
graphics go in your handout, this space is for a brief summary of
your project.

## Summary
This project looks into incidents of racial violence in the American South between 1930 and 1954, with the aim of uncovering historical trends as well as recognizing the legacy of racial violence and its relevance to ongoing systemic inequities.

This dataset includes information on the location, timing, victim demographics, perpetrator types. These variables allow for a detailed analysis of geographic and time-influenced trends, as well as the social dynamics of such violence. One key aspect of the dataset is its focus on the Southern USA, where racial violence was deeply rooted in institutional and cultural practices. Mapping incidents at the county level highlights both areas of concentrated violence and the significant gaps in reporting of incidents. These gaps, due to the covert nature of many crimes and historical biases in record-keeping, show the dataset’s inherent limitations. Our data interpretations keep this in mind, analyzing the information we have while still taking into account that the historical context may be causing inaccuracies in our findings.
