Racial Violence in the American South: An Analysis of Killings in the 1930s–1950s 
by MEG Team: Esme McDonald, Gus Rivers-McHugh, Maxie Langenberg


## Summary
This project looks into incidents of racially motivated killings in the American South between 1930 and 1954, with the aim of uncovering historical trends as well as recognizing the legacy of racial violence and its relevance to ongoing systemic inequities.

This dataset includes information on the location, timing, victim demographics, perpetrator types. These variables allow for a detailed analysis of geographic and time-influenced trends, as well as the social dynamics of such violence. One key aspect of the dataset is its focus on the Southern USA, where racial violence was deeply rooted in institutional and cultural practices. Mapping incidents at the county level highlights both areas of concentrated violence and the significant gaps in reporting of incidents. These gaps, due to the covert nature of many crimes and historical biases in record-keeping, show the dataset’s inherent limitations. Our data interpretations keep this in mind, analyzing the information we have while still taking into account that the historical context may be causing inaccuracies in our findings.
 
## Methods

Our data is sourced from The Burnham-Nobles Archive of The Civil Rights & Restorative Justice Project at Northeastern University School of Law. The dataset has 43 variables describing everything from the victim’s occupation to the FBI case number (if one exists), we spent a significant amount of time experimenting with different visualization types in an attempt to find meaningful relationships between different aspects of each case. After our preliminary analysis, we decided our areas of focus would be incident counts by location, gender of the victims, and overall timeline. Our initial plots included a ridge plot by deaths, organized by state, as well as a simple bar plot showing death count by victim’s gender. However, the relationship between gender and other variables was not as clear as we had hoped. Of the reported incidents in our dataset of 955, only 4% were committed against women. This is likely not due to a true low count, but again points toward the issue of missing data. Violence against women, in any context, is historically under reported. Especially considering the circumstances of these crimes, it’s sadly not unexpected that reported killings of women are so low. Beyond gender, we chose to continue focusing on location-based numbers, as well as perpetrator group type and differences in rate from state to state. All of our visualizations seek to uncover a newly archived legacy of racial violence and its relevance to ongoing systemic inequities. 

## Analysis
Time and location are both very important factors when it comes to the trends in our dataset.
For instance, the sharp concentration of incidents in Jefferson County, Alabama highlights its role as a hotspot for racial violence during the 1930s-1950s. The City of Birmingham is located in Jefferson County, a famously important location of the American civil rights movement that would gain strength in the late 50s and 60s. Peaks in violent incidents may correlate with pivotal events or shifts in segregation policies, or broader historical moments such as the end of Reconstruction, the rise of Jim Crow laws, and the intensification of white supremacist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan. Zoning ordinances and segregation fueled the fire of racial violence to intimidate civil rights groups and people in the Fourth Avenue District, where black businesses were segregated to the Third, Fourth, and Fifth North Avenue which became a meeting place for civil rights groups over the 1950s and 60s. The end of Reconstruction in 1877 marked a pivotal moment, as federal efforts to ensure civil rights for African-Americans were abandoned, which in turn led to a resurgence of white-controlled Southern governments that quickly imposed policies of oppression against African-American populations. These laws set the stage for the ingrained violence that would define the Southern USA in the first half of the 20th century. During this time, white supremacist groups such as the KKK became more organized and active, particularly in rural areas where local law enforcement was either complicit or inactive. Although the economic hardships of the Great Depression in the 1930s led to a temporary decline in KKK activity, the larger culture of white supremacy laid the foundation for the racially charged violence that would continue into the 1950s, as segregationist policies remained largely intact​. 

In many instances, police were directly responsible for violence or complicit in allowing it to occur, such as by failing to protect victims from lynch mobs or by engaging in discriminatory practices themselves. This is evident in the high number of police perpetrators in the bar plot below. Murders by police were often justified under the guise of law enforcement, and cops were frequently directly responsible for violence or complicit in allowing it to occur. Black individuals could be killed for minor perceived slights or infractions, as in cases documented in the late 1940s where officers used lethal force in response to a refusal to adhere to racist social norms like addressing white individuals as "sir" or removing hats in their presence. Additionally, police were integral to maintaining the status quo of racial inequality, as they often acted in service of white supremacist political and legal cultures. This included refusing to investigate or prosecute crimes against Black individuals or even delivering victims to white mobs. 


## Conclusion
This dataset offers a critical lens into historical patterns of racial violence, despite its limitations in reporting. Although we focus on a time period over 70 years ago, the information is still incredibly relevent now and into the future, by emphasizing the importance of acknowledging and addressing the historical roots of racial inequity and the ongoing impact of systemic oppression. The insufficient data for some parts of our dataset reflects the greater challenges in documenting racial killings, including the silencing of Black voices and the historical ignorance of legal and social institutions. This project aims to demonstrate and publicize the need for continued research to uncover and memorialize these stories, ensuring that they remain a remembered part of our nation’s history.
