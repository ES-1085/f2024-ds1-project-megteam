Racial Violence in the American South: An Analysis of Killings in the 1930s–1950s 
================
by MEG Team: Esme McDonald, Gus Rivers-McHugh, Maxie Langenberg


## Summary
This project looks into incidents of racially motivated killings in the American South between 1930 and 1954, with the aim of uncovering historical trends as well as recognizing the legacy of racial violence and its relevance to ongoing systemic inequities.

This dataset includes information on the location, timing, victim demographics, perpetrator types. These variables allow for a detailed analysis of geographic and time-influenced trends, as well as the social dynamics of such violence. One key aspect of the dataset is its focus on the Southern USA, where racial violence was deeply rooted in institutional and cultural practices. Mapping incidents at the county level highlights both areas of concentrated violence and the significant gaps in reporting of incidents. These gaps, due to the covert nature of many crimes and historical biases in record-keeping, show the dataset’s inherent limitations. Our data interpretations keep this in mind, analyzing the information we have while still taking into account that the historical context may be causing inaccuracies in our findings.
 
## Methods

Our data is sourced from The Burnham-Nobles Archive of The Civil Rights & Restorative Justice Project at Northeastern University School of Law. The dataset has 43 variables describing everything from the victim’s occupation to the FBI case number (if one exists), we spent a significant amount of time experimenting with different visualization types in an attempt to find meaningful relationships between different aspects of each case. After our preliminary analysis, we decided our areas of focus would be incident counts by location, gender of the victims, and overall timeline. Our initial plots included a ridge plot by deaths, organized by state, as well as a simple bar plot showing death count by victim’s gender. However, the relationship between gender and other variables was not as clear as we had hoped. Of the reported incidents in our dataset of 955, only 4% were committed against women. This is likely not due to a true low count, but again points toward the issue of missing data. Violence against women, in any context, is historically under reported. Especially considering the circumstances of these crimes, it’s sadly not unexpected that reported killings of women are so low. Beyond gender, we chose to continue focusing on location-based numbers, as well as perpetrator group type and differences in rate from state to state. All of our visualizations seek to uncover a newly archived legacy of racial violence and its relevance to ongoing systemic inequities. 

## Analysis

## Conclusion
This dataset offers a critical lens into historical patterns of racial violence, despite its limitations in reporting. Although we focus on a time period over 70 years ago, the information is still incredibly relevent now and into the future, by emphasizing the importance of acknowledging and addressing the historical roots of racial inequity and the ongoing impact of systemic oppression. The insufficient data for some parts of our dataset reflects the greater challenges in documenting racial killings, including the silencing of Black voices and the historical ignorance of legal and social institutions. This project aims to demonstrate and publicize the need for continued research to uncover and memorialize these stories, ensuring that they remain a remembered part of our nation’s history.
